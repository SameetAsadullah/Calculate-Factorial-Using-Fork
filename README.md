<h1 align="center">Find Factorial Using Fork</h1>

### Description
A simple `C++ Program` to find `Factorial` of given number using `Fork System Call`. There are `Two Variations` of the code, you can execute whichever variation you want.
1) Takes `Input in Parent Process` and calculates factorial in child process `(main)`
2) Takes `Input in Child Process` and calculates factorial in parent process `(main0)`

### Manual

2) Use the following command to `Run the Code`:
    ```
    ./a.out
    ```
